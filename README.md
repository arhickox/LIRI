Welcome to LIRI, the Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

LIRI is a node application that allows you to search from 3 different APIs at will

Here's how it works:

At the command line, type in one of the following things (sans the quotation marks).

* " concert-this your_band_name " where your_band_name is replaced with the name of a band you want to learn more about upcoming tour dates using the Bands in Town API

* " spotify-this-song your_song_name " where your_song_name is replaced with the name of a song you want to have information displayed of using the Spotify API

* " movie-this your_movie_name " where your_movie_name is replaced with the name of a movie you want to display information for using the OMDB API

* " do-what-it-says " will execute the command written in random.txt, which by default will search the Spotify Database for information on the 1999 Backstreet Boys song 'I Want it That Way'.

Note: As of right now this application doesn't work at all, I am planning to return to it in the near future once I figure out the fatal flaw. Thanks.
